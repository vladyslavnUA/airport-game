## Setting
This Unity 2D player game takes place inside an airport, where a person's suitcase has just 
burst open 10 minutes before their flight! They must jump over other obstacles (other passengers luggage) 
in order to collect all of your clothes. The game takes you through separate different terminals in the airport, as the wind has landed your clothes
thoughout each terminal. Hopefully you'll make the flight, I sure tried.

## Controls
```
The controls for this game is similar to the basic 2D standards:
- W | ↑ (jump) 
- A | ← (left)
- S | ↓ (crouch)
- D | → (right)
Since there are no enemies, no shooting will occur in this version.
```

## Winning
In order to win, simply collect all of the missing clothes (15 total) and you will reach the line to your plane.
